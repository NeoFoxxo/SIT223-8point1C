// Stage 1: Build – Build the code using a build automation tool to compile and package
// your code. You need to specify at least one build automation tool, e.g., Maven.
// Stage 2: Unit and Integration Tests – Run unit tests to ensure the code functions as
// expected and run integration tests to ensure the different components of the
// application work together as expected. You need to specify test automation tools for
// this stage.
// Stage 3: Code Analysis – Integrate a code analysis tool to analyse the code and ensure
// it meets industry standards. Research and select a tool to analyse your code using
// Jenkins
// Stage 4: Security Scan – Perform a security scan on the code using a tool to identify
// any vulnerabilities. Research and select a tool to scan your code.
// Stage 5: Deploy to Staging – Deploy the application to a staging server (e.g., AWS EC2
// instance).
// Stage 6: Integration Tests on Staging – Run integration tests on the staging
// environment to ensure the application functions as expected in a production-like
// environment.
// Stage 7: Deploy to Prod
